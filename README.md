# User Interface Project

An interactive web application that generates multiplication tables and allows users to customize the UI colors dynamically. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive UI design.

## About

This project allows users to input a number and generate its multiplication table dynamically. Additionally, users can select from multiple color themes (Red, Green, Blue, Dark) to customize the appearance of the UI elements in real time.

It is a practical example for beginners learning JavaScript event handling, conditional rendering, and CSS styling through DOM manipulation.

## Features

* Generate multiplication tables for numbers from 1 to 10.
* Input validation with user-friendly messages for empty inputs.
* Dynamic UI feedback (colors, button text, borders) based on user actions.
* Four color themes to customize background and text colors interactively.
* Clear and responsive design for better user experience.

## How It Works

1. **Multiplication Table Generation**

   * User enters a number in the input field and clicks the "Submit" button.
   * The app checks if the input is empty and displays an error message if so.
   * If valid, it generates the multiplication table from 1 to 10 for the given number and displays it dynamically.

2. **Color Theme Selection**

   * Four buttons let the user pick a color theme: Red, Green, Blue, or Dark.
   * When a color button is clicked, the background, text colors, and button states update accordingly.
   * The selected color theme is displayed prominently to the user.

## Usage

* Enter a number in the input field and click **Submit** to see its multiplication table.
* If the input is empty, you’ll be prompted to enter a valid number.
* Click one of the color buttons (Red, Green, Blue, Dark) to change the UI colors dynamically.
* Modify the code to customize features or add new functionalities.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5** — Webpage structure and form elements
* **CSS3** — Styling, layout, and responsive design
* **JavaScript** — DOM manipulation, event listeners, and interactivity
